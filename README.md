# CNI_Hackathon_2022

# Guide

1. Fork this repository. It has two files.
    1. game.py - This is the code for the game which was provided by the Hackathon organising team. Donâ€™t make any changes in this code.
    2. Player1.py - This is the code of the bot which I submitted for the contest.
    3. Player2.py - This is your bot. You need to complete the move function
2. Install the pygame package to run the game.py file. 
3. Run the game.py file to pit your bot against mine.

Tips - Comment out line 84 in game.py (sleep(0.1)) to speed up the computation.

Happy Coding!!!
